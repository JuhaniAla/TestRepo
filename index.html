	<p>I play smash every day in school, and I'm ranked as the best Ness in Finland <br>
		I still have a lot to learn in the game, and visiting tournaments helps me out a lot in figuring out new stuff to learn. <br>
		My next smash tournament is <a href ="https://smash.gg/tournament/bob-omb-battlefield-1/events/ultimate-singles/overview"> Bob-omb Battlefield </a> <br>
		This is the biggest Smash tournament in Finland</p>
